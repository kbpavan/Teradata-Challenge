# Teradata-Challenge

Executive Summary:

More than 250,000 U.S. military members leave the service each year. Without effective transition assistance, many could join the ranks of more than 500,000 veterans already unemployed or underemployed in the United States. Military spouses also encounter unique job search challenges, leading to an unemployment rate five times the national average. The 2017 Hire Heroes Report is an in-depth analysis of data collected from more than 19,000 US military members, veterans and military spouses who signed up for Hire Heroes USA services in 2017, including nearly 12,000 job seekers who became clients in Hire Heroes’ Partnered Career Transition (PaCT) program.
Our research on this data and the valuable insights that are developed from various demographics can be used by other veteran service organizations, think tanks, and federal entities to get a better understanding of the transitioning military, veteran and military spouse community, the challenges and experiences of job seeking veterans and military spouses. https://www.hireheroesusa.org/about-us/

The main goal of our project is to gain insights from the data of Hire heroes 2017 report and help Hire heroes understand the transitioning of military community in their career. The findings from our analysis are to be presented for the 2019 Teradata challenge. We have taken Hire Hero's 2017 data as a sample and extending our analysis to entire military population in coming years.

Project Objectives:

To understand and determine the important relationships between the HHUSA client’s demographic profile and when they registered for services, who will be a confirmed hire, and finally who will complete the survey.

Our goal is to predict Alumni survey Completion based on demographic profiles
